# IPL-Web-Scrapping

This web scrapper gives us all the stats of all the players who participated in IPL 2020 - 2021. 
It fetches all the details like player name, no. of runs scored, no. of balls played, fours, sixes, and strike rate for each individual player and stores them in a folder (Script written to store details automatically).
At last, all these data are exported into individual excel sheets for every player.
